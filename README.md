# RobDroneGo Project Overview

RobDroneGo is a prototype system designed to manage and execute tasks using a fleet of robots and drones within the ISEP campus. This project was developed as part of the LAPR5 course in the Computer Engineering program at ISEP. The project encompasses several modules:

## Modules
- **Device Management**: Overseeing the robots and drones.
- **Task Request Management**: Handling task requests from users.
- **Task Execution Planning**: Planning the execution of tasks.

## Device Types
- **Robisep**: A mobile robot navigating indoors via wheels, capable of surveillance, cleaning, or delivering items within buildings.
- **Droneisep**: A drone operating outdoors, capable of object delivery, surveillance, image acquisition, and exterior window cleaning.

## User Roles
- **System Administrator**: Manages users and permissions.
- **Fleet Manager**: Manages data on robots and drones.
- **Campus Manager**: Manages routes and maps.
- **User**: Requests task execution.

Users can register to request tasks, such as delivering items. Initially, task approval and scheduling are manual but may evolve to automated processes. The system plans routes for devices, taking into account building layouts and connectivity.

## Prototype Assumptions
This prototype assumes basic functionality, such as object transport and security surveillance, with safety and data protection considerations. It aims to demonstrate the solution with a campus of at least five buildings, multiple floors, and several rooms per floor.

## Additional Features
- **Web Management Interface**: For managing system information.
- **Advanced Planning Algorithm**: For route identification and task sequencing.
- **3D Visualization Module**: For exploring the campus and viewing routes.

The system complies with GDPR regulations, ensuring data privacy and user rights.
